# demolab

Demolab is my fantasy project created to understand the power of `JAMstack` using `JavaScript(Reactjs)`, `API(Netlify and Aws)` and pre-built Markup(`Gatsby`).

- The demolab is hosted @ [https://demo.greenroots.info/](https://demo.greenroots.info/)
- Read this for more details: [Hey, I have made a demolab using JAMstack](https://blog.greenroots.info/hey-i-have-made-a-demolab-using-jamstack-ckeeiohqp0032f7s15c4c3ro6)
